What Didn't Work and Why

1. Combining urgency and routing logic led to messy code.
2. Missed urgency when language was vague but angry.
3. Keyword-only routing missed nuance.
4. High urgency tickets landed in general_support.
5. Underestimated new users’ urgency.
6. Pydantic AI wasn’t compatible with Colab initially.
7. Prompts too vague at first.
8. Didn't prioritize high-revenue clients properly.
9. Metrics lacked depth until later.
10. Thresholds needed tuning with real data.
